# Face-Mask-Detector
Implemented a Deep Learning based model to validate if a person is wearing a face mask in a real-time remote video stream. The model also analyzes if the mask is worn partially or incorrectly and can be deployed as a standalone program.
### 1. train_mask_detector.py
Creates a face mask detector model using given data set.
### 2. detect_mask_video.py
Loads the built model and predicts output on a live video stream.
## Launching the program
1. Activate the virtual environment.
2. Run "detect_mask_video.py" using terminal.
